      Dear #{@feed.user.email},
      %br
      your credentials to access #{@feed.authentication_provider.title} have expired, and your social feed
      %i= @feed.name
      has been disabled.
      %br
      Any new content from #{@feed.authentication_provider.title} won't be displayed anymore on your #{link_to @feed.board.name, board_url(@feed.board)} collection, unless you disconnect and re-connect to #{@feed.authentication_provider.title}, granting access to your social account.
      %br
      %br
      Please
      = link_to 'manage your social connections', edit_user_registration_url
      to solve this problem.
    %p
      Sincerly,
      %br
